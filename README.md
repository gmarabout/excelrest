# Excelrest

I needed this tool for a personal project. It covers only a very small usecase which is to expose an Excel file (.xlsx extension) as a (readonly) REST API.
I made this code for my personal use ONLY, and I do not guarantee that it might be useful for anything else than my own personal interest.
In fact, I can guarantee that it won't be.

Do I need to mention that this project is not intended to be used in a serious (industrial) context?
